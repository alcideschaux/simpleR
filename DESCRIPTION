Description: This package contains a set of functions to describe
    numerical and categorical data using tables and plots through
    simplified functions. Plots used include histograms and boxplots
    for numerical variables, and bar plots for categorical (factor)
    variables. Tables present data as counts and percentages. Inferential
    statistics are also provided, including P values estimated using
    Kruskal-Wallis test for grouped numerical variables and Fisher's 
    exact test for contingency tables. The package also contains
    functions to plot survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method and
    to compare them using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. A set of
    functions allow to render logistic regression tables including odds
    ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95CI) and P values, and to 
    depict OR and 95CI using forest plots.
